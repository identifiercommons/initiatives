###[The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting)
>The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a protocol developed for harvesting (or collecting) metadata descriptions of records in an archive so that services can be built using metadata from many archives. An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, but may also support additional representations.
