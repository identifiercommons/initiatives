### [identifiers.org](http://identifiers.org)
> Identifiers.org is a system providing resolvable persistent URIs used to identify data for the scientific community, with a current focus on the Life Sciences domain.

### [Identifier Mapping Service](https://github.com/openphacts/IdentityMappingService/)
> Uses [data description documents](http://www.openphacts.org/specs/datadesc/) to describe datasets and the links between identifiers that represent the entitities within them.

###[The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting)
>The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a protocol developed for harvesting (or collecting) metadata descriptions of records in an archive so that services can be built using metadata from many archives. An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, but may also support additional representations.

###[N2T Name-to-Thing Resolver](https://n2t.net/)
The N2T resolver keeps names (identifiers) of things persistent by forwarding them to their current web addresses. You can also use N2T to look up descriptions (metadata) of named things. It doesn't matter if the thing is a document, dataset, book, statue, museum specimen, vocabulary term, symphony orchestra, etc. N2T can work with any kind of internet name: URL, ARK, DOI, URN, Handle, LSID, etc.
The EZID service is currently the main way to add to N2T's database of names, descriptions, and forwarding addresses.
